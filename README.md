# wc-clone

ccwc — A Python Clone of the Unix wc Command

This project is my implementation of the Coding Challenges exercise to recreate the behaviour of the Unix wc (word count) tool.

The program supports counting:

Lines (-l)

Words (-w)

Bytes (-c)

Characters (-m)

Default output: lines words bytes

Reading from files or from standard input
