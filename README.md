# wc-clone

ccwc — A Python Clone of the Unix wc Command

This project is my implementation of the Coding Challenges exercise to recreate the behaviour of the Unix wc (word count) tool.

The program supports counting:

Lines (-l)

Words (-w)

Bytes (-c)

Characters (-m)

Default output: lines words bytes

Reading from files or from standard input


Options
Flag	Long form	Description
-c	--byte	Print the number of bytes
-l	--line	Print the number of lines
-w	--word	Print the number of words
-m	--char	Print the number of characters
